Fail Log for Module 3 Exercises

‘Regex and the Republic of Texas’ has been the my favourite exercise to do so far. After I got the hang of using DH box after the Module 2 Exercises, I realize how easy it can be when you get the hang of it. Coding in DH box was the best part for me, because I had less fails, so it took up less time to do. However, it was my first time using RegExr.com and it was difficult at first for me. I had trouble plugging in what I wanted to remove from my text, but eventually I got the hang of it. When I tried to deposit some of text into RegExr, I accidentally took too much text. I tried to go through the large amount of text I copied, however it took too long so I decided to copy the first paragraph of names from the texas.txt to copy and paste into RegExr. When I plugged in the expression “/.+,.+,.+,/g” into the expression application, it found several issues in the text. I had a large amount of text so it was approximately 145 matches. After cleaning up my data, I realized that this exercise was simpler however it was a lot of work.
